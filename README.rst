TurnKey Dev Tracker (Issues & Wiki)
===================================

TurnKey uses GitHub's project management features to track development.

Resources:

1) The `Issue Tracker`_ is used to report and track bugs, issues and
   feature requests related to TurnKey Linux. 

2) The `Wiki`_ is used to propose and track appliance candidates,
   and also as a general purpose whiteboard.
   
This tracker is **NOT** intended to be used as:

* A `support forum`_ we already have one of those.
* A `general discussion forum`_, we have one of those as well.

Reporting a bug, issue or feature request
-----------------------------------------

The ideal bug/issue includes:

* A detailed description of the issue.
* How to reproduce the issue step by step.
* Any extra information that might be relevant, such as appliance
  name, version, deployment (ISO, OpenStack, Amazon EC2), any
  changes made prior to issue, etc.

The ideal feature request includes:

* A detailed description of feature and component it relates to.
* One or more use cases for the feature.
* Any extra information that might be relevant.

Before creating a new issue, please check to see if a similar issue
already exists. If it does, post a comment showing it also affects you. 
Knowing an issue effects multiple users is useful when we decide how
to prioritize limited development resources. Please try and include any additional 
information you think might help us close the issue.
