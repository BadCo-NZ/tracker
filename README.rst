TurnKey Linux Tracker (Issues and Wiki)
=======================================

The `Issue Tracker`_ is used to report and track bugs, issues and
feature requests related to TurnKey Linux. The `Wiki`_ is used to
propose and track appliance candidates, as well as a whiteboard.

What it's not:

    * A `support forum`_, we already have one of those.
    * A `general discussion forum`_, we have one of those as well.

Reporting a bug, issue or feature request
-----------------------------------------

The ideal bug/issue includes:

    * A detailed description of the issue.
    * How to reproduce the issue step by step.
    * Any extra information that might be relevant, such as appliance
      name, version, deployment (ISO, OpenStack, Amazon EC2), any
      changes made prior to issue, etc.

The ideal feature request includes:

    * A detailed description of feature and component it relates to.
    * One or more use cases for the feature.
    * Any extra information that might be relevant.

Before creating a new issue, please check to see if a similar issue
already exists. If it does, post a comment showing it also affects you
with more information.

Please try and avoid ``me too``, ``+1``, ``same here`` type empty
comments. Given this, it's useful to know the issue affects multiple
people so we can give it priority. In this case, please try and include
information that would help in closing the issue.
